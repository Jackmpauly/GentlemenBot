#GentlemenBot

----------------------------------------------------------------
This is just a little project I've been making on my own time as sort of a challenge for myself. Without any prior knowledge of discord.js, node.js, or even javascript, I sought out to create my own discord bot for my personal discord server! This little project has shown me my strengths and weaknesses as a programmer, forced me to learn an entirely new programming language, and has pushed me to become more creative in general! I've spent God knows how many hours on this project, tweaking the code, adding commands, making the code more efficient, etc. I'm having a lot of fun making and adding on to this as time goes on and seeing the reactions I get from my friends testing it out.

Also, I want to put a little disclaimer out there that I am new to javascript, so if some parts look sloppy or could be done better, bear with me and let me know!

Also also, I'm like 99% sure this project cannot be forked and used out of the box at the moment. I've been developing this project on my machine, for my machine and haven't tested portability yet.
